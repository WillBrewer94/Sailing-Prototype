# Sailing-Prototype
Unity prototype for a 2D exploration game involving boats and exploration

World Ideas:
Some cataclysmic event has shattered north america, turning it into a series of islands.

Cemented Game Mechanics:
-Method of traveling around islands on a ship in a top down view.
-Moving from the ocean to an island shifts the perspective to a 2D sidescroller.

Potential Game Mechanics (Testing):
-Map divided into sections, each with a wind direction. Player must move their ship in a way to maximise wind thrust, using angles.
-Between islands are "current corridors" that will move the player faster in either direction. Moving outside these corridors has slower
movement, but potential for untapped or unexplored areas. Start off with no engine, so ship must follow these corridors, but eventually 
can upgrade ship to explore these areas faster.
